# Simple Things Yet
SimpleThingsYet is a modern personal blog where the only author posts blogs on a wide range of categories such as personal growth, lifelong learning, mental health, and general life observations/experiences.

I am uncertain and not entirely conscious about my decision to use the blog name. I know that it derives from the idea that what may seem simple at first impression, yet they could be helpful, challening, complex, etc.
