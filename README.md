# Simple Things Yet
SimpleThingsYet is a modern blogging application where the only author posts blogs on a wide range of categories such as personal growth, lifelong learning, mental health, and general life observations/experiences. 

The app brand/name is built around the idea that life's simplest things often hide the most complexity, depth, and meaning. However, the blog is about my personal experiences/investigations, mostly.
